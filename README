This is an unstable release of the SuperTux Milestone 2 editor. Do not
expect everything to work smoothly and save often...

== Prerequisites ==

 * SuperTux version 0.3.0 or higher
 * OpenGL driver and environment
 * mono 1.2.2.1 or newer
   (1.1.13 or newer may work but if it doesn't, don't blame us just
    upgrade to 1.2.2.1 or newer)
 * gtk-sharp 2.8 or newer


== Building ==

Type
	make


== Running ==

You can start the editor by typing
	mono supertux-editor.exe

To run with debugging info (that is the only way to get a usable
backtrace for a bug report in case of a crash):
	mono --debug supertux-editor.exe

Remember to set your SuperTux paths in the editor options!


== Known Problems ==

The open source ATI drivers seem to have problems with multiple viewports
and shared textures.
