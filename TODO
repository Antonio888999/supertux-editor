SuperTux Editor
===============

* +/- zoom buttons do not zoom to the center of the screen

* Object Tool should behave more like Inkscape:

  - LMB on an object to select
  - LMB on the background to start a select-rectangle
  - LMB+move to drag objects it around
  - Shift+LMB to add an object to the selection
  - RMB for context menu

* Select Tool should be removed (identical to Object Tool)

* replace tool crashes:

  Note: Applications can use GLib.ExceptionManager.UnhandledException to handle the exception.
System.Collections.Generic.KeyNotFoundException: The given key was not present in the dictionary.

* Replace Tool should document its functions in a status bar message

* Path Tool doesn't seem to do anything

* Tiles Tool doesn't display the current tile

* add a Sector Menu in the main menubar containing:

  New Sector
  Delete Sector
  Resize Sector
  Sector Properties
  Camera Properties

* make Object Properties a separate Window, instead of having it in a
  VPaned (having it dockable like in Gimp would be best, but likely to
  complicated to do in Gtk+)
